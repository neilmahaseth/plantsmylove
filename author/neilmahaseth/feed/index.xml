<h4> <br>Reasons for Propagating Lemongrass</h4>



<p>There are multiple reasons for me to propagate my lemongrass plant </p>



<ul><li>The lemongrass plant was growing in the same soil for more than 2 years. By propagating it I  wanted to give it a fresh start as it was not looking great.</li><li>I also wanted to grow it on my terrace garden. Lemongrass plant thrives in the full sun and the heat that I get on my terrace garden. </li></ul>



<h4>Procedure for Propagation by Division </h4>



<p>Propagation through division is a simple process. You need to divide the plant into different parts. Each part has a section root system intact so can be grown independently. The key to successful propagation from the division is to reduce the amount of root loss during the division process. Once the plant has been divided you will need to place them in a partially shaded environment for a couple of weeks. For the roots to recover and start growing again. If a significant amount of root has been lost you will need to place them in a humidity dome.</p>



<h4>Remove Plant from the Grow Bag </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1365" height="768" data-id="680"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Remove-Plant-from-the-Grow-Bag.webp" alt="Remove Plant from the Grow Bag" class="wp-image-680"/><figcaption>Remove Plant from the Grow Bag</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The first step is to unpot the plant. Since I grew the lemongrass plant in a grow bag. I can remove it by slowly unrolling it.  </p>



<h4>Remove Soil from Roots Using Water </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-4 wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="681"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Remove-Soil-from-Roots-Using-Water.webp" alt="Remove Soil from Roots Using Water" class="wp-image-681"/><figcaption>Remove Soil from Roots Using Water</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Once you have unpotted the plant your next step is to remove the soil from the roots. I will do this using a stream of water from a pipe. The water will wash away the soil leaving only the bare roots.</p>



<h4>Divide the Plant </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-6 wp-block-gallery-5 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="682"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Divide-the-Plant.webp" alt="Divide the Plant" class="wp-image-682"/><figcaption>Divide the Plant</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Now once the soil has been removed you can separate out the lemongrass clumps. Each clump should have a root system. I will use this blade to separate the lemongrass plants into four plants. </p>



<h4>Remove Dead Plant Parts </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-8 wp-block-gallery-7 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="685"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Remove-Dead-Plant-Parts.webp" alt="Remove Dead Plant Parts" class="wp-image-685"/><figcaption>Remove Dead Plant Parts</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Once you have divided the plants make sure to remove any decomposing or dried lemongrass plant parts. This will clean up the plant and prevent any fungal or bacterial diseases. </p>



<h4>Growing Medium </h4>



<p>I will be using almost pure pigeon manure to grow my divided lemongrass. As lemongrass is grown for the leaves it requires soil rich in nitrogen. Pigeon manure is an excellent source of nitrogen. Since the manure I am using is quite aged. It will not be super strong for the plants. </p>



<h4>Transplant the Divided Plants </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-10 wp-block-gallery-9 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="683"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Transplant-the-Divided-Plants.webp" alt="Transplant the Divided Plants" class="wp-image-683"/><figcaption>Transplant the Divided Plants</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Now transplant the separated lemongrass plant to individual containers with the pigeon manure as the potting soil. You can use any potting soil make sure to add nitrogen-rich compost to it.</p>



<h4>Place Plant in Partial Shade </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-12 wp-block-gallery-11 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="684"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Place-Plant-in-Partial-Shade.webp" alt="Place Plant in Partial Shade" class="wp-image-684"/><figcaption>Place Plant in Partial Shade</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Once you have transplanted them keep them in partial shade. This will allow them to recover from the root loss and the transplant shock. You might need to keep them for around 15-20 days for them to stabilize.</p>



<h4>Water the Transplanted Plants </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-14 wp-block-gallery-13 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="686"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Water-the-Transplanted-Plants.webp" alt="Water the Transplanted Plants" class="wp-image-686"/><figcaption>Water the Transplanted Plants</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Make sure to water all of them thoroughly till you see water coming out from the bottom drainage holes.</p>



<h4>Trim the Leaves</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-16 wp-block-gallery-15 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="687"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Trim-the-Leaves.webp" alt="Trim the Leaves" class="wp-image-687"/><figcaption>Trim the Leaves</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>If during the division process a lot of roots have been lost then you can trim the leaves. This will prevent water loss from transpiration. However, doing this will also mean that the plant will take a longer time to recover.</p>



<h4>Add Humidity Dome</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-18 wp-block-gallery-17 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="688"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Add-Humidity-Dome.webp" alt="Add Humidity Dome" class="wp-image-688"/><figcaption>Add Humidity Dome</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>You might also need to keep the plants in a humidity dome. If you have lost almost all the roots in the lemongrass plant. This will help the plants to stay alive till it regrows their roots.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBABfbvOonw&amp;t=0s">0:00</a> Intro </li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBABfbvOonw&amp;t=58s">0:58</a> Propagate Mint from Layering </li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBABfbvOonw&amp;t=262s">4:22</a> Propagate Mint from Runners </li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBABfbvOonw&amp;t=463s">7:43</a> Propagate Mint From Cuttings</li></ul>



<h4>1 Propagate Mint from Layering</h4>



<p>Layering is a propagation method where we bury a part of the stem in the ground. This is done without separating the stem from the parent plant. The stem over time develops roots. When a sufficient amount of root grows in the buried stem. You can separate this stem from the parent plant to create a clone layered plant. </p>



<p>The benefit of layering is you can do this in any climate. Even when humidity is low and temperature is high. Plants can be propagated using layering. Another benefit is unlike growing from cutting you do not need to place it in partial shade or add a humidity dome. This is because the layered plant is fed by the mother plant till the time roots are forming.</p>



<h5>1.1 Insert Stems Through Holes</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-20 wp-block-gallery-19 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="667"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Insert-Stems.webp" alt="Insert Stems" class="wp-image-667"/><figcaption>Insert Stems</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>To start the layering process first take a container with large drainage holes.</li><li>Insert the mint stems one by one through these holes. </li></ul>



<h5>1.2 Remove Bottom Leaves</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-22 wp-block-gallery-21 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="668"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Remove-Bottom-Leaves.webp" alt="Remove Bottom Leaves" class="wp-image-668"/><figcaption>Remove Bottom Leaves</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Remove the lower leaves from the stems which were inserted through the holes.</li><li>The lower part of the stem will be buried in the rooting medium so removing levels prevent diseases.</li></ul>



<h5>1.3 Fill Perlite Rooting Medium</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-24 wp-block-gallery-23 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="669"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Fill-Perlite-Rooting-Medium.webp" alt="Fill Perlite Rooting Medium" class="wp-image-669"/><figcaption>Fill Perlite Rooting Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Use an inert rooting medium like perlite which prevents fungal and bacterial infection.</li><li>Fill the container with perlite till only the top leaves of the mint stem are visible.</li><li>Gently takeout stems which are fully buried inside the soil.</li></ul>



<h5>1.4 Water The Medium</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-26 wp-block-gallery-25 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="670"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Water-the-Medium.webp" alt="Water the Medium" class="wp-image-670"/><figcaption>Water the Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Using a spray bottle gently water the layered mint stems.</li><li>Add water till you see it drain through the drainage holes.</li><li>Make sure to keep the perlite moist for around 15-20 days. </li><li>After 15-20 days your layered plants can be transplanted into soil. </li></ul>



<h4>2 Propagate Mint from Runners </h4>



<p>Mint plant naturally spreads itself using an underground root system called runners. These roots grow horizontally just below the soil surface. In the right condition, these roots send out new shoots. These runners can be separated from the parent plant to create a clone.</p>



<p>Propagating mint from runners is quick and gives a mint plant that has a well-developed root system.</p>



<h5>2.1 Find Mint Runner</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-28 wp-block-gallery-27 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="671"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Find-the-Runner.webp" alt="Find the Runner" class="wp-image-671"/><figcaption>Find the Runner</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Scrape along the sides of a mint patch.</li><li>You should find stems going horizontally along the soil surface.</li><li>These are shoots sent out from the runner.</li><li>Remove more dirt to reveal the mint runner with the root system.</li></ul>



<h5>2.2 Cut Out a Section of Runner with Root System</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-30 wp-block-gallery-29 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="672"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Cut-Out-a-Section-of-Runner-with-Root-System.webp" alt="Cut Out a Section of Runner with Root System" class="wp-image-672"/><figcaption>Cut Out a Section of Runner with Root System</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Dig out a large section of the runner with a large root system.</li><li>Using a pair of scissors or a pruning shear cut and separate the runner from the parent plant.</li></ul>



<h5>2.3 Bury Mint Runner in Potting Soil</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-32 wp-block-gallery-31 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="673"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bury-Mint-Runner-in-Potting-Soil.webp" alt="Bury Mint Runner in Potting Soil" class="wp-image-673"/><figcaption>Bury Mint Runner in Potting Soil</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Take a pot and fill it with a well-draining potting soil partially.</li><li>Now place the cut-out mint runner on top of this pot and bury it under the potting soil.</li><li>Within 15-20 days the shoots from the runners will emerge from the soil.</li></ul>



<h4>3 Propagate Mint From Cuttings</h4>



<p>Propagating plants from cuttings is the most common way of plant propagation. If done properly under the right weather conditions you can achieve a 100% success rate. </p>



<h5>3.1 Select the Stem for Cuttings</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-34 wp-block-gallery-33 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="674"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Select-the-Stem-for-Cuttings.webp" alt="Select the Stem for Cuttings" class="wp-image-674"/><figcaption>Select the Stem for Cuttings</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Select a mint stem that is thick and around 6-7 inches long.</li><li>Cut the stem right below the node region from where the leaves emerge.</li></ul>



<h5>3.2 Place the Stems in water after cutting</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-36 wp-block-gallery-35 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="675"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Place-the-Stems-in-water-after-cutting.webp" alt="Place the Stems in water after cutting" class="wp-image-675"/><figcaption>Place the Stems in water after cutting</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>While you take multiple cuttings make sure to place the cut stems directly in water to prevent them from dehydrating.</p>



<h5>3.3 Prepare the Cuttings for Propagation</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-38 wp-block-gallery-37 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="676"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Prepare-Stem-for-Cutting-Propagation.webp" alt="Prepare Stem for Cutting Propagation" class="wp-image-676"/><figcaption>Prepare Stem for Cutting Propagation</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>To prepare the cuttings for propagation remove the lower leaves</li><li>If your mint stem cutting has large leaves at the top you can snip them in half</li><li>Remove any branches and flower buds present on the stem cutting</li></ul>



<p>By doing this you will reduce water loss through transpiration and allow the stem to focus its energy on root development.</p>



<h5>3.4 Place the Cuttings in Perlite Rooting Medium</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-40 wp-block-gallery-39 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="678"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Place-the-Cuttings-in-Perlite-Rooting-Medium.webp" alt="Place the Cuttings in Perlite Rooting Medium" class="wp-image-678"/><figcaption>Place the Cuttings in Perlite Rooting Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Use an inert growing medium like perlite this will prevent any fungal and bacterial problems in your cuttings</li><li>Partly fill the container with perlite and then place the cutings inside.</li><li>Burry the cuttings by adding the remaining perlite to fill the container.</li></ul>



<h5>3.5 Water the Cuttings &amp; Place a Humidity Dome</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-42 wp-block-gallery-41 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="677"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Place-a-Humidity-Dome.webp" alt="Place a Humidity Dome" class="wp-image-677"/><figcaption>Place a Humidity Dome</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Water the cuttings thoroughly till you see the water coming out from the drainage holes.</li><li>Place the cutting inside a humidity dome to maintain high humidity levels for easier root growth.</li><li>Place the container in a place that receives indirect bright light like under a tree.</li></ul>

<p>At first, you need to know about the things which you can not fully control. Like the climate, the pests, and animals at your place. We will first start with the climate.</p>



<h4>1 General Idea of Earth&#8217;s Climate</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-44 wp-block-gallery-43 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="655"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Climate.webp" alt="General Idea of Earth's Climate" class="wp-image-655"/><figcaption>General Idea of Earth&#8217;s Climate</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Understanding how the earth&#8217;s climate changes depending upon the location will allow you to select the right plants for your vegetable container garden. </p>



<h5>Equatorial </h5>



<p>Generally speaking the climate at your place depends upon your location from the equator. If you are located near the equator then you will have an equatorial climate. Which does not vary throughout the year. You will have a lot of rainfall and warm temperatures around 25-30 °C. The most common example of this climate is the Amazon Rainforest. You can grow many vegetables and herbs in this climate throughout the year, but cool-season plants will not grow.</p>



<h5>Tropical</h5>



<p>As we move away from the equator we enter the tropical region. In this region, we see an annual seasonal variation in the climate causing winters and summers. Apart from this, the winters are very mild and the summers are not very hot. You will also see a lot of rainfall throughout the year. An example of a country having this climate can be Thailand. Just like the equatorial climate in the tropics, you can grow a lot of vegetables and herbs but cool-season plants will not grow.</p>



<h5>Sub-Tropical</h5>



<p>Now once we move further away from the equator we reach the subtropics. This region has got a diverse set of climate but generally speaking this region host almost all of the world&#8217;s hot deserts including the largest Sahara desert. The climate in this region is hot &amp; dry and winters are very mild. In peak summer it can be very challenging to grow vegetables and herbs. But in the winters you can grow summer season vegetables. But you will not be able to grow cool-season plants because the winters are very short and not that cold.</p>



<h5>Temperate</h5>



<p>Lastly, on going further away from the equator we reach the temperate region. In this region, the winters are very harsh and the summers are mild. In the summers you can grow plants that like the heat and in the early winters you can grow cool-season vegetables. However, once the temperature goes below freezing.  You can not grow plants outside as the frost will kill most of the plants.</p>



<h4>2 Find The Climate at Your Place</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-46 wp-block-gallery-45 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="656"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Accuweather.webp" alt="Accuweather" class="wp-image-656"/><figcaption>Accuweather</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Apart from the distance from the equator, several other factors can affect the climate at your place.  So to know exactly how the climate changes throughout the year for your place. You can check the website <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/">https://www.accuweather.com/</a></p>



<p>Just type the name of your city and then click on the monthly tab. This will show you the historical average min and max temperatures for the entire year. This will give you a good idea of the climate at your particular place. And how it changes throughout the year.</p>



<h5>Ahmedabad Climate</h5>



<figure class="wp-container-48 wp-block-gallery-47 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="665"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Monsoon.webp" alt="Monsoon" class="wp-image-665"/><figcaption>Monsoon</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>We are situated in the subtropical region. Soroudended by hot deserts. The Arabian desert in the far west and the Thar Desert in the north. The summers in Ahmedabad are very harsh. The average maximum temperature lies at around 43 °C. During the peak, summer temperatures reach as high as 47  °C. It is almost impossible to grow plants without shade cloth on my terrace garden. Because we are situated in the Indian subcontinent we have a very unique monsoon climate. </p>



<p>Every year from 15th June to 30th September we receive a lot of rainfall due to the South West Monsoon. Which brings the moisture-laden clouds from the Indian ocean up to the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. But apart from this wet phase, we receive negligible rains in the remaining part of the year. This cause the air and soil to become very dry when summers peak. </p>



<p>The Winters are very mild as good as the summer in a temperate climate. So we can grow warm-season vegetables during the monsoon season and in the winters. But is difficult to grow cool-season vegetables. In the summers you will need to use shade cloth and misters to grow vegetables which I have not tried yet.</p>



<h5>Best Food Gardening Season In India</h5>



<p>If you are reading this article from India then the best time to start a vegetable and herbs garden is during the monsoon season. However, you will need to spray neem oil once a week to prevent insect attacks.</p>



<h4>3 Identify the Pests and Animals in Your Area</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-50 wp-block-gallery-49 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="657"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pest-and-Animals.webp" alt="Pest and Animals" class="wp-image-657"/><figcaption>Pest and Animals</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Once you have got a general idea about your climate. The next thing which you cannot control is the pest and animals present at your place. These animals and pests will freeload on your hard-earned crop. So planning for them beforehand will be useful. Check with your neighbors who have vegetable and herb gardens to know the exact nature of pests and animals causing problems in your area. Once you have identified them you can try adding enclosures around your garden. To prevent them from being raided by the animals. If that is not possible you can grow plants that the animals and pests do not like. You can also use organic pesticides like neem oil to deter them from munching on your crop.</p>



<h5>Main Pest in our Area</h5>



<p>In our place, the main pest is the monkey. During harvest time they will come sneakily into the garden. And then raid the plants as if we had grown all the plants just for them. They are quite smart and I have tried different ways to protect my harvest. But over time they figure out how to bypass the protection. The only way to protect your crop from these greedy monkeys is to garden in a metal cage. However, this year I will be using a different technique. </p>



<h4>4 Select the Correct Plants </h4>



<p>Now, depending on your climate, pest, and animals at your place, you can decide on the plants you wish to start growing in your food garden. If you can not invest a lot of time and effort. I would suggest that you start by growing green leafy vegetables and herbs. These are generally easier to grow and care for compared to fruiting crops. Once you get good results with this you can then slowly expand to growing fruiting crops. </p>



<h5>Plants I Will Be Growing</h5>



<p>This year I will be growing crops that monkeys do not like to eat. Like chili, bottle gourd, cucumber, greens like amaranth, and herbs like mint, basil, and lemongrass also crop having tubers like ginger, potato, sweet potato, etc.</p>



<h4>5 Buy Good Quality Seeds &amp; Raising Seedlings </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-52 wp-block-gallery-51 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="664"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Seeds-and-Seedlings.webp" alt="Seeds and Seedlings" class="wp-image-664"/><figcaption>Seeds and Seedlings</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>If you are just starting I would suggest you go for buying mature plants from a nursery than starting plants from seeds. Some plants can be easily started from seeds. But most vegetable plants require a lot of time and care to get mature plants. For example, starting chili from seed will take you 2 months to get the mature plant which can then be transplanted into a bigger container. Apart from time, you will also need to take proper care of watering the tiny seedlings. It is like taking care of a baby. But if you have the time and inclination then it can be very rewarding. Seeing the tiny seeds develop into huge mature plants. I personally always start plants from seeds. </p>



<p>If you are going to purchase seeds make sure you get good quality seeds. The seed packet should have the packaging date mentioned on it. Because seeds older than a year, stored at room temperature have a poor germination rate. If you are from India you can get good quality seeds at an economical rate from Aero Seeds. They create a seed packet from an assortment of different vegetables and herbs. The number of seeds per plant type is limited but is good enough for one growing season. They sell online through Flipkart and Amazon over here <a href="https://amzn.to/3nomUm0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://amzn.to/3nomUm0</a></p>



<h4> 6 Size Your Containers Correctly  </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-54 wp-block-gallery-53 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="663"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Container-Size.webp" alt="Container Size" class="wp-image-663"/><figcaption>Container Size</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>While selecting the plants you need to keep in mind the size of the containers required. Large vines like bottle gourd and cucumber require around 18-20 inch wide containers. If grown in smaller containers they will grow but will not produce yield to their full potential. </p>



<p>Greens and herbs can be grown in much smaller containers. You can grow multiple varieties of greens in around  8-10 inch containers.   </p>



<h4>7 Plan Your Container Garden Layout </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-56 wp-block-gallery-55 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="662"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Container-Garden-Layout.webp" alt="Container Garden Layout" class="wp-image-662"/><figcaption>Container Garden Layout</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To decide on the placement of the containers. You need to know the direction of the sun and the movement of shadows. Depending on the temperature and intensity of the sun. You can place the containers where your growing area receives the maximum sunshine. If you have higher temperatures you can use the shadows to your benefit like how I have done.</p>



<p>I have placed my grow bags in two-row. The first row faces the east so it receives the full morning sunshine. During the evening when it gets hot it gets shaded by the wall behind it. The second row is placed right in the middle of the terrace so it gets full sun all through the day. In this row, I will be growing the larger gourd family plants that can tolerate the heat.</p>



<h4>8 Prevent Water Seepage </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-58 wp-block-gallery-57 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="661"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Prevent-Water-Seepage.webp" alt="Prevent Water Seepage" class="wp-image-661"/><figcaption>Prevent Water Seepage</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>If you are growing plants on your terrace. You need to ensure that water does not get collected beneath your containers. There should be enough air circulation so that any moisture between your terrace floor and containers dries out quickly. This is important to prevent damage to your building because of water seepage. You can do this by installing your containers on a raised metal stand that is available on the market. In my terrace garden, I have used things that were lying around in my house. To<a href="https://plantsmylove.com/how-to-prevent-water-seepage-in-your-terrace-garden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> create a DIY stand </a>for my container terrace garden. I have used bricks or tiles placed on granite stones to raise the containers. I have also used an old thick PVC pipe and the curvature of my terrace edge to support the tiles and bricks. </p>



<h4>9 Create the Perfect Potting Soil and Organic Fertilizer</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-60 wp-block-gallery-59 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="660"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Potting-Soil-and-Additives.webp" alt="Potting Soil and Additives" class="wp-image-660"/><figcaption>Potting Soil and Organic Fertilizer</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Good potting soil should be light, airy, rich in nutrients, and drain freely. You can purchase store-bought potting soil which can be soil-less and made from cocopeat, perlite, and added organic fertilizers. I like to be self-sufficient which saves me money and at the same time helps the environment by reducing waste. So I prepare my potting soil on my own using <a href="https://plantsmylove.com/how-to-make-homemade-compost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homemade vegetable compost</a>, normal garden soil, and <a href="https://plantsmylove.com/make-bone-meal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homemade bone meal</a>. Once the plant starts producing flowers and fruits you will need to fertilize them weekly.</p>



<h4>10 Mulching Your Soil </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-62 wp-block-gallery-61 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="659"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mulching.webp" alt="Mulching" class="wp-image-659"/><figcaption>Mulching Your Soil </figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Mulching is a must if you are growing in containers even with raised bed garden mulching helps. There are several benefits of mulching. Mulching helps in retaining soil moisture thus preventing frequent watering. It also keeps the weed in check in addition to reducing the soil temperature by blocking the sunlight from heating the soil. If you are in a windy area then mulching will also prevent soil erosion due to strong breeze. You can create mulch from any organic material that is slow to decompose you can also use plastic as mulch. I have used the leaves of my coconut tree as mulch.</p>



<h4>11 Irrigating Your Garden</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-64 wp-block-gallery-63 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="658"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Irrigation.webp" alt="Irrigation" class="wp-image-658"/><figcaption>Irrigating Your Garden</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Once you have done all of this the only important ingredient left to get a bountiful harvest is water. You can water your containers manually but make sure to use a spray bottle or a watering can. If you pour water directly on the soil the force of the water stream will cause compaction and erosion. The fine spray from a spray bottle will elevate this problem. You can purchase a spray bottle from the market or you can make one yourself using a <a href="https://plantsmylove.com/diy-sprayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pet soda bottle</a>.  </p>



<p>If you are planning to create a large container or backyard garden I would suggest you invest in a <a href="https://plantsmylove.com/install-drip-irrigation-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drip irrigation system</a>. From my own experience, I can say this reduces the gardening effort by several times. You can also add an electric valve to the system which will automate the entire process of watering. So you can go on a vacation without worrying about your plants.</p>

<p>Hi friends in this video I will show you how I propagate Pothos from layering. We will discuss the benefits of propagating by layering vs cutting water propagation. As always I will share with you step-by-step details.  Pothos or Money Plant is very easy to propagate. It can grow roots by simply placing them in water. But in this article, I will show you how to propagate Money Plant using layering. </p>

<h4>Money Plant from Cutting Water Propagation</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-66 wp-block-gallery-65 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="630"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Money-Plant-from-Cutting-Water-Propagation.webp" alt="Money Plant from Cutting Water Propagation" class="wp-image-630"/><figcaption>Money Plant from Cutting Water Propagation</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This is my money plant which I propagated using the normal water cutting propagation. This is around a 2-month-old plant. But compared to the money plant which I propagated using layering just a month ago this is very small. Even the root system is tiny.</p>



<h4>Pothos Propagated Using Layering</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-68 wp-block-gallery-67 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="629"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Pothos-Propagated-Using-Layering.webp" alt="Pothos Propagated Using Layering" class="wp-image-629"/><figcaption>Pothos Propagated Using Layering</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This is a month-old Pothos plant that developed this vigorous root system in just 20 days in the rooting medium. You can see how huge this is compared to the one which was propagated using water cutting.</p>



<h4>Benefits of Propagating Devils Ivy Layering vs Cutting </h4>



<p>There are several benefits of cloning Money Plant using layering </p>



<ul><li>The rooting time is less compared to cutting propagation.</li><li>You can get a large plant cloned.</li><li>It can be done in a climate that is not suitable for cutting propagation like hot and dry weather.</li></ul>



<h4>How to Propagate Money Plant Using Layering </h4>



<p>So now let&#8217;s look step by step at how you can get your <span style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13); font-family: Roboto, Noto, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400;">Devil&#8217;s Ivy</span> cloned using layering.</p>



<h4>1. Find a Long Pothos Vine </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-70 wp-block-gallery-69 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="628"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Find-a-Long-Pothos-Vine.webp" alt="Find a Long Pothos Vine" class="wp-image-628"/><figcaption>Find a Long Pothos Vine</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This is my Pothos plant the first step is to find a long vine that you can easily bend and place inside a pot. I will use the same vine using which I had propagated using layering previously. </p>



<h4>2. Use an Inert Growing Medium Perlite </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-72 wp-block-gallery-71 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="627"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Use-an-Inert-Growing-Medium-Perlite.webp" alt="Use an Inert Growing Medium Perlite" class="wp-image-627"/><figcaption>Use an Inert Growing Medium Perlite</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The second step is to prepare the rooting medium.  You need to use an inert growing medium like perlite. This prevents any fungal and bacterial issues while rooting the plant. Apart from that perlite also has an excellent water-to-air ratio. Which allows the root enough oxygen while keeping it moist at the same time. Also, it is impossible to overwater perlite if the drainage of the container is proper. Perlite being very light does not hinder root growth.</p>



<h4>3. Keep 2-3 Nodes Inside the Growing Medium </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-74 wp-block-gallery-73 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="626"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Keep-2-3-Nodes-Inside-the-Growing-Medium.webp" alt="Keep 2 3 Nodes Inside the Growing Medium" class="wp-image-626"/><figcaption>Keep 2 3 Nodes Inside the Growing Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Now you need to make sure that the vine which you will be layering should have at least 2-3 Nodes buried in perlite. The node region on the stem is where the leaves emerge. Root growth also happens in this region. So by placing 2-3 nodes in the rooting medium you are doubling or tripling the chance of root development.   </p>



<h4>4. Choose How Long The New Money Plant You Need </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-76 wp-block-gallery-75 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="625"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Choose-How-Long-The-New-Money-Plant-You-Need.webp" alt="Choose How Long The New Money Plant You Need" class="wp-image-625"/><figcaption>Choose How Long The New Money Plant You Need</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Now decide on the length of your newly cloned money plant will be. The stem that will be coming out from the planter will be your new plant. </p>



<h4>5. Prepare Money Plant Vine for Layering </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-78 wp-block-gallery-77 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="624"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Prepare-Money-Plant-Vine-for-Layering.webp" alt="Prepare Money Plant Vine for Layering" class="wp-image-624"/><figcaption>Prepare Money Plant Vine for Layering</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Using a pair of scissors cut the leaves from the part of the stem which will be buried inside the perlite. After that bend the stem inside the pot so that it is placed in the middle.</p>



<h4>6. Use a Stone to Anchor it in Place </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-80 wp-block-gallery-79 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="623"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Use-a-Stone-to-Anchor-The-Vine.webp" alt="Use a Stone to Anchor The Vine" class="wp-image-623"/><figcaption>Use a Stone to Anchor The Vine</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The stone anchors the vine and makes sure that it does not come out of the planter. The stone apart from providing support to the vine. Also, ensure the node region is in good contact with the perlite.</p>



<h4>7. Bury The Vine In the Growing Medium </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-82 wp-block-gallery-81 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="622"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bury-The-Vine-In-the-Growing-Medium.webp" alt="Bury The Vine In the Growing Medium" class="wp-image-622"/><figcaption>Bury The Vine In the Growing Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Now add the remaining perlite to cover the entire vine. Make sure all the node region is well inside the perlite.  </p>



<h4>8. Keep the Pot Moist </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-84 wp-block-gallery-83 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="621"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Keep-the-Pot-Moist.webp" alt="Keep the Pot Moist" class="wp-image-621"/><figcaption>Keep the Pot Moist</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The last thing you need to do is make sure that the perlite does not dry out. Since I have a drip irrigation system installed in my garden I will add a dripper to this planter. You can simply water it daily. As we have used perlite there will be no problem with overwatering. </p>



<h4>9. Results After 1 Month</h4>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://plantsmylove.com/propagate-money-plant/"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iU9QM4HLUW4/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br /><br /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<p>Hi friends in this video we will learn how to clone your chili pepper plant using air layering. Air layering is a vegetative propagation method similar to cutting. But unlike growing by cutting the plant is separate from the mother plant after root development. There is also the benefit that you do not need to care about the weather condition for it to start rooting. As the plant will get an ample supply of nutrients and water from the mother plant while it develops its own root system. </p>

<h4>1. Things Required</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-86 wp-block-gallery-85 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="605"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Things-Required-2.webp" alt="Things Required" class="wp-image-605"/><figcaption>Things Required</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>You will need the following things:-</p>



<ul><li>An Inert Growing Medium like Perlite, Coco Peat, Peat Moss.</li><li>Rooting Hormone (Optional)</li><li>String</li><li>Plastic Sheet</li><li>Stapler</li><li>Scissor</li></ul>



<h4>2. <span style="color: initial;">Prepare Branch for Air Layering </span></h4>



<figure class="wp-container-88 wp-block-gallery-87 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="606"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Prepare-Branch-for-Air-Layering.webp" alt="Prepare Branch for Air Layering" class="wp-image-606"/><figcaption>Prepare Branch for Air Layering</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To prepare the stem find a node region from where a new branch is coming out. Cut the leaves and branches near the node region. This will create the space for adding the plastic bag. Now apply the rooting hormone all around the node region you can do this using a brush also.</p>



<h4>3. <span style="color: initial;">Prepare Plastic Bag </span> </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-90 wp-block-gallery-89 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="607"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Prepare-Plastic-Bag.webp" alt="Prepare Plastic Bag" class="wp-image-607"/><figcaption>Prepare Plastic Bag</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Cut a sheet of plastic that is long enough to cover the node region. The width of this plastic sheet should be good enough to carry the rooting medium. Now place this plastic sheet on the prepared branch. Using staples fold it in the shape of a cylinder to cover the complete branch node region. Using a string seal the bottom end of this cylinder.   </p>



<h4>4. <span style="color: initial;">Fill Plastic Bag with Growing Medium</span></h4>



<figure class="wp-container-92 wp-block-gallery-91 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="608"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fill-Plastic-Bag-with-Growing-Medium.webp" alt="Fill Plastic Bag with Growing Medium" class="wp-image-608"/><figcaption>Fill Plastic Bag with Growing Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Make sure the medium is moist and then fill it up in the created plastic bag. I have used a small spoon so that it is easier to fill. Tap the medium so that there is no air gap in the node region. </p>



<h4><span style="color: initial;">5. Seal Plastic Bag using Thread </span></h4>



<figure class="wp-container-94 wp-block-gallery-93 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="609"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Seal-Plastic-Bag-using-Thread.webp" alt="Seal Plastic Bag using Thread" class="wp-image-609"/><figcaption>Seal Plastic Bag using Thread</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Once completely filled seal the plastic packet from the top using a string. This will ensure that the perlite will remain moist consistently. And that&#8217;s it now you just have to wait for a month. After one month you should see the root development. As we have used transparent plastic it will be easier for us to know when the root has developed well enough to sustain the cutting.</p>

</figure>



<h5>Drip Pipes and Drip Emitter</h5>



<ol><li>16 mm UV Protected HDPE Drip Line<ul><li>This is the main drip irrigation pipe that will supply water to all the drip emitters.</li></ul></li><li>4 mm UV Protected LDPE Feeder Line<ul><li>This pipe from one end is connected to the main 16 mm drip line and on the other end, the drip emitter is attached to your growing container.</li></ul></li><li>Drip Emitter<ul><li>This is the main drip creation device, use a high-quality one that automatically unclogs and creates drops instead of streams.</li></ul></li></ol>



<h5>Water Reservior </h5>



<ol id="block-380bff2d-e321-4d38-b796-4a6cd5f44b57"><li> Two 2 Liter Soda PET Bottle Reservoir<ul><li>We will be using this to store the water for our gravity-fed drip irrigation system.</li></ul></li></ol>



<h5>Connectors</h5>



<ol><li>16 mm Tee Connector  (Optional)<ul><li>This is used when you want to split the main 16mm drip line into different sections.</li></ul></li><li>16 mm Straight Connector<ul><li>This allows for the extension of the 16 mm drip line by connecting the pipe in a straight direction.</li></ul></li><li>16 mm Elbow Connector<ul><li>If you want to bend the 16 mm drip line then this connector is used. </li></ul></li><li>4mm T Connector  (Optional)<ul><li>Using this connector you can attach two 4 mm feeder lines to a single hole in the 16mm drip line.</li></ul></li><li>4mm Pin Connector<ul><li>To connect a single 4 mm feeder line to a hole in the 16 mm drip line use this connector.</li></ul></li></ol>



<h5>Miscellaneous</h5>



<ol><li>Drip Line Hole Punch Tool<ul><li>This is used to punch holes in the main 16 mm drip line to connect the 4 mm feeder line.</li></ul></li><li>Arrow Emitter Stakes<ul><li>This helps to anchor the 4mm feeder line in your growing container. </li></ul></li><li>End Cap<ul><li>This is used to seal the 16 mm drip pipe end to create pressure for the drip irrigation system.</li></ul></li><li>&nbsp;3/4 Inch Screen Filter (Optional)<ul><li>If the water you revive contains a lot of particulate impurities then you will need to filter it using this to prevent clogging the drip emitter. </li></ul></li></ol>



<h4>1. Design and Plan The System</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-98 wp-block-gallery-97 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="586"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Design-and-Plan-The-System.webp" alt="Design and Plan The System" class="wp-image-586"/><figcaption>Design and Plan The System</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Decide your container garden location based on the amount of direct sunlight and the amount of shadow needed depending on ambient temperature.</li><li>I have placed my grow bags facing the east this ensures that it receives full morning sunlight.</li><li>In the evening when it gets very warm in Ahmedabad the terrace parapet wall will provide shade to the plants.</li><li>Decide on the location, height, and support system for your water reservoir.</li><li>Count the number of planters you will be connecting to the drip irrigation system and accordingly calculate the number of drip emitters and length of 4mm feeder pipe required.</li><li>Measure the total length of the 16 mm drip line required to cover your entire growing area and the water reservoir.</li><li>After making all the measurements cut the required length of 16 mm drip pipe and 4 mm feeder pipe. </li></ul>



<h4>2. Connect The Drip Line Together</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-100 wp-block-gallery-99 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="587"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Connect-The-Drip-Line-Together.webp" alt="Connect The Drip Line Together" class="wp-image-587"/><figcaption>Connect The Drip Line Together</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Join the entire drip irrigation system together using the different connectors based on your requirements.</li><li>You can use a cigarette lighter to heat the 16 mm drip pipe slightly to easily insert the fittings without a lot of effort.</li><li>Also, use gloves to protect your hand from blisters caused by excessive friction between the drip pipe and your skin. </li><li>To connect connectors use a rocking motion with a forward push to firmly connect the drip pipe and the connector.</li><li>Using the drip line punch tool create the holes where you want to connect the drip emitter to your planter. </li></ul>



<h4>3. Hide Drip Line Behind the Grow Bag</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-102 wp-block-gallery-101 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="589"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hide-Drip-Line-Behind-the-Grow-Bag.webp" alt="Hide Drip Line Behind the Grow Bag" class="wp-image-589"/><figcaption>Hide Drip Line Behind the Grow Bag</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Place the drip pipe behind the grow bags to make it more aesthetically pleasing by hiding the pipes from view.</p>



<h4>4. Anchor Drip Emitter in Container</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-104 wp-block-gallery-103 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="588"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Anchor-Drip-Emitter-in-Container.webp" alt="Anchor Drip Emitter in Container" class="wp-image-588"/><figcaption>Anchor Drip Emitter in Container</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Using the arrow emitter stakes firmly attach the drip emitter to the planter.</p>



<h4>5. Plastic Rope to Support Reservoir</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-106 wp-block-gallery-105 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="590"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Plastic-Rope-to-Support-Reservoir.webp" alt="Plastic Rope to Support Reservoir" class="wp-image-590"/><figcaption>Plastic Rope to Support Reservoir</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Use a plastic rope to tie the water reservoir created from a 2-liter PET soda bottle to a supporting structure.</p>



<h4>6. Adjust the Drip Line Height</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-108 wp-block-gallery-107 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="591"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Adjust-the-Drip-Line-Height.webp" alt="Adjust the Drip Line Height" class="wp-image-591"/><figcaption>Adjust the Drip Line Height</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>You might need to adjust the height of your drip pipe and water reservoir to ensure all the drip emitters are working.</li><li>This is because of the small pressure difference created by a gravity-fed drip irrigation system where the reservoir is not placed very high.</li><li>This results in some drippers working whereas others running dry.</li><li>I was able to fix this problem by increasing reservoir height and making sure that the drip pipe height is the same throughout.</li><li>You can support the drip pipe by placing it between the grow bags and the wall.</li></ul>



<h4>7. Redesign Reservoir Support System</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-110 wp-block-gallery-109 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="592"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Redesign-Reservoir-Support-System.webp" alt="Redesign Reservoir Support System" class="wp-image-592"/><figcaption>Redesign Reservoir Support System</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>I have increased the reservoir height by taking support from the concrete design on my terrace parapet</li><li>The second wire provides support to the second 2-liter bottle which is placed on top of the first like a mineral water bottle dispenser system.  </li></ul>



<h4>8. Final Working of the Drip Line</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-112 wp-block-gallery-111 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="593"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Final-Working-of-the-Drip-Line.webp" alt="Final Working of the Drip Line" class="wp-image-593"/><figcaption>Final Working of the Drip Line</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Now fill the reservoir with full 4 liters of water and sit back and enjoy your gravity-fed drip irrigation system.</p>



<p>As the water is emitted from the drippers you will see air bubbles rise in the top mineral water bottle just like what happens in a mineral water bottle dispenser.</p>

<p>In this video learn how you can transplant small seedlings grown in a shallow pot into a bigger pot. I will show you using amaranth seedlings but you can do this to any small plants.</p>



<p>I will be transplanting seedlings from my <a href="https://plantsmylove.com/make-cement-planter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DIY cement planter</a>. But you can use this same method to transplant seedlings from any pot. Ideally, a shallow pot is better for seedling transplantation. </p>

<h4>Water the Seedlings Thoroughly </h4>



<figure class="wp-container-114 wp-block-gallery-113 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="567"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Water-the-Seedlings-Thoroughly.webp" alt="Water the Seedlings Thoroughly" class="wp-image-567"/><figcaption>Water the Seedlings Thoroughly</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Before transplanting the seedling make sure to thoroughly moisten the seedlings.</li><li>Doing this will allow us to easily dig out the seedlings.</li><li>Also, the moisture will help the soil to stick to the roots creating our root ball.</li><li>I am using a <a href="https://plantsmylove.com/diy-sprayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DIY Garden sprayer </a>which prevents seedlings from getting disturbed and allows uniform moisture.</li></ul>



<h4>Plan the Plant Placement</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-116 wp-block-gallery-115 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="568"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Plan-the-Plant-Placement.webp" alt="Plan the Plant Placement" class="wp-image-568"/><figcaption>Plan the Plant Placement</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Depending on the type of plant you are growing plan the number of plants and the distance between them.</li><li>For growing Amarnath in containers as a leaf crop, you can grow it in two rows 5 cm apart in a 15 cm wide grow bag.</li></ul>



<h4>Use a Tool to Dig Out Seedlings</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-118 wp-block-gallery-117 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="569"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Use-a-Tool-to-Dig-Out-Seedlings.webp" alt="Use a Tool to Dig Out Seedlings" class="wp-image-569"/><figcaption>Use a Tool to Dig Out Seedlings</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>I will use a small spoon to scoop out seedlings with the root ball intact.</li><li>Place the spoon a few cm away from the seedling stem and press it inside the growing medium.</li><li>Once it reaches the entire depth of the pot apply a gentle upwards force at an angle to scoop out the seedling.</li></ul>



<h4>Remove the Seedlings with Root Ball Intact</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-120 wp-block-gallery-119 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="570"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Remove-the-Seedlings-with-Root-Ball-Intact.webp" alt="Remove the Seedlings with Root Ball Intact" class="wp-image-570"/><figcaption>Remove the Seedlings with Root Ball Intact</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Once the seedling has been loosened out from the container using your hands gently pull it away from the pot.</li><li>If the root ball is coming apart, gently press the root ball to prevent it from breaking.</li></ul>



<h4>Dig a Hole and Gently Place the Seedling</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-122 wp-block-gallery-121 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="571"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Dig-a-Hole-and-Gently-Place-the-Seedling.webp" alt="Dig a Hole and Gently Place the Seedling" class="wp-image-571"/><figcaption>Dig a Hole and Gently Place the Seedling</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Depending on your seedling placement plan dig a hole using your hand.</li><li>Then gently place the transplanted seedling inside the hole.</li><li>Cover the hole with soil and gently press around the seedling stem to support it.</li></ul>



<h4>Add Mulch to Retain Moisture</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-124 wp-block-gallery-123 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="572"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Add-Mulch-to-Retain-Moisture.webp" alt="Add Mulch to Retain Moisture" class="wp-image-572"/><figcaption>Add Mulch to Retain Moisture</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Mulching is very important if you are doing container gardening.</li><li>Mulch not only suppresses weeds but more importantly reduces the soil temperature and helps in retaining soil moisture.</li><li>Mulching can be done using anything which decomposes slowly like dried leaves, dried grass clippings, or straw.</li><li>I am using old milk packets as mulch because it is white which will reflect the sunlight from the soil surface, therefore, reducing the soil temperature. </li><li>Fold the milk packets and using them cover any open soil surface near the seedlings.</li><li>Tuck them inside near the edge of the grow bag to prevent them from flying away.</li></ul>



<h4>Water the Transplants Thoroughly</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-126 wp-block-gallery-125 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="573"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Water-the-Trasnplants-Thoroughly.webp" alt="Water the Trasnplants Thoroughly" class="wp-image-573"/><figcaption>Water the Transplants Thoroughly</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>After transplanting all the seedlings make sure to water them thoroughly. </li><li>This will endure any air gaps between the newly transplanted seedlings and the growing medium is filled up with soil.</li><li>Make sure to water using a fine garden sprayer this will prevent the small sledding from getting dislodged. </li></ul>



<h4>Seedling Update After 24 Hrs</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-128 wp-block-gallery-127 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="574"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Growth-Update-after-24-Hrs.webp" alt="Growth Update after 24 Hrs" class="wp-image-574"/><figcaption>Growth Update after 24 Hrs</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>After 24 hrs you can see most of the transplanted seedlings have survived the critical stage.</li><li>Some of them did not make it this can be because I was not able to get the complete root ball intact for some of the seedlings.</li></ul>



<h4>Replace Failed Transplants with Backup Seedlings</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-130 wp-block-gallery-129 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="575"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Replace-Failed-Transplants-with-Backup-Seedlings.webp" alt="Replace Failed Transplants with Backup Seedlings" class="wp-image-575"/><figcaption>Replace Failed Transplants with Backup Seedlings</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>Always keep some backup seedlings that come in handy plugging the gaps the failed seedlings created.</li><li>Using the same method transplant the backup seedling in place of the failed seedlings.</li></ul>



<p>I hope friends, you liked this step-by-step guide on transplanting seedlings. Hope using this guide you will be able to transplant more seedlings successfully.

<h4>Seed Starting Using Spray Bottle</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Seed-Starting-Using-Spray-Bottle.webp" alt="Seed Starting Using Spray Bottle" class="wp-image-551"/><figcaption>Seed Starting Using Spray Bottle</figcaption></figure>



<p>A spray bottle is very useful in seed starting. Especially if the seeds are tiny. Using the sprayer you can be sure that once seeds are sowed the water will not dislodge them. After the tiny seedling emerges. You can still water them using the spray bottle. This is because the stream of water is so thin that it can not disturb the seedlings.</p>



<h4>Benefits Of Irrigating using Spray Bottle</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-132 wp-block-gallery-131 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="552"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Benefits-Of-Irrigating-using-Spray-Bottle.webp" alt="Benefits Of Irrigating using Spray Bottle" class="wp-image-552"/><figcaption>Benefits Of Irrigating using Spray Bottle</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Using a spray bottle you can uniformly irrigate the soil because the fine spray does not flow away. This means when you spray water in the growing medium it will stay put till it is absorbed by it. Instead of flowing away and causing soil erosion.</p>



<h4>Irrigating Shallow Pot using Spray Bottle</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-134 wp-block-gallery-133 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="553"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Irrigating-Shallow-Pot-using-Spray-Bottle.webp" alt="Irrigating Shallow Pot using Spray Bottle" class="wp-image-553"/><figcaption>Irrigating Shallow Pot using Spray Bottle</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Using a garden sprayer also comes in handy when you need to water pots that do not have the depth for water to stand. The gentle water spray generated from the sprayer allows the water to be absorbed by the growing medium slowly. This prevents water from overflowing the pot and causing soil erosion.</p>



<h4>Things Required</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-136 wp-block-gallery-135 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="554"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Things-Required.webp" alt="Things Required" class="wp-image-554"/><figcaption>Things Required</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ul><li>You will need a <strong>Soda PET bottle</strong> you can use any size 2 l or 500 ml depending on how big you want your spray bottle to be.</li><li>You will need a<strong> mineral water bottle cap</strong> because this is made from thin plastic you can easily make holes in it using a pin.</li><li>Lastly, you will need a <strong>pin or needle</strong> the thinner the tip the better.</li></ul>



<h4>Make a Garden Sprayer</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-138 wp-block-gallery-137 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="555"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Make-a-Garden-Sprayer.webp" alt="Make a Garden Sprayer" class="wp-image-555"/><figcaption>Make a Garden Sprayer</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<ol><li>Remove the soda bottle cap and screw in the mineral water bottle cap.</li><li>Now using the pin pierce holes in the mineral water bottle cap.</li><li>Be careful not to overlap two holes.</li><li>Keep creating holes using the needle till the full surface area is covered.</li></ol>



<p>That&#8217;s it you have now created your own DIY spray bottle. To use it simply fill the bottle with water. Invert the bottle and press it till you see a shower coming out from the cap. </p>

<p>Hi friends in this video learn how you can propagate Arabian Jasmine from stem cutting. Jasmine is a tropical plant and it has got several different varieties. The variety that we&#8217;ll be talking about is Arabian jasmine. Arabian jasmine is a native species of tropical Asia. It grows natively in south Asia as well as southeast Asia. It is the national flower of Indonesia as well as the Philippines.</p>

<h4>1 Jasmine Plant Information</h4>



<p>In India, it is used in wedding ceremonies as a garland. In addition, it is used in hair decoration the Hindi term for it is called Gajara. It&#8217;s used to decorate the hair buns. As well as it&#8217;s a sacred flower so it is offered to the gods during worship.  </p>



<p>Arabian jasmine has got a beautiful smell. Perfumes, as well as herbal tea, are made using jasmine flowers. Jasmine tea is made using freshly plucked flowers which are mixed with green tea leaves. Over one week, Tea leaves absorb the scent of the jasmine flower. After that, the jasmine flower is separated from the tea leaves. This is then sold as jasmine tea.</p>



<p>The Hindi name for jasmine is mogra. Jasmine can only be propagated via cutting. As it does not produce any seeds or any fruit for that matter. I will show you how you can propagate Arabian jasmine in a sweltering hot and dry climate.  We are based located in India in Ahmedabad which has got an arid subtropical climate. At present, the average day&#8217;s high temperature is around 42°C. But in the coming days, it has been projected to go as high as 44 °C. Given such bad weather, I&#8217;ll show you how you can still propagate Jasmine from cutting by taking proper precautions.  So without wasting much time let&#8217;s get started&#8230;</p>



<h4>2 Reasons for Propagating</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-140 wp-block-gallery-139 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="542"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Reasons-for-Propagating.webp" alt="Reasons for Propagating" class="wp-image-542"/><figcaption>Reasons for Propagating</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Okay friends this is my jasmine plant. As you can see it&#8217;s not very dense. It&#8217;s quite old it&#8217;s around five to six years old plant. Previously it used to get very bushy and used to flower a lot. Every year we used to cut it back and it used to grow double the size. But now the stems have grown quite old. In fact, the termite has also infected some of them. So the first reason for propagating it is to save this plant and give it a new life. </p>



<p>One more issue with this plant is it flowers for only 2 months in the whole year. I suspect this is because of its location. The plant is placed facing the north and so only receives full sun in March and April.  In the winter season, it does not receive any direct sunlight. I think due to this it does not bloom in the winters. So the second reason for propagating this plant from cutting is to change its location. Hopefully, that will make it bloom for a longer period. So let&#8217;s start the process.</p>



<h4>3 Select Jasmine Stem for Cutting</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-142 wp-block-gallery-141 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="531"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Select-Jasmine-Stem-for-Cutting.webp" alt="Select Jasmine Stem for Cutting" class="wp-image-531"/><figcaption>Select Jasmine Stem for Cutting</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>You can grow jasmine plants by cutting using softwood as well as semi-hardwood stem cutting. Softwood stem is new growth that is completely green in color and is very flexible. Whereas the semi-hardwood stem is greenish-brown in color. They are also quite firm and can not be bent without breaking. Hardwood stem is a more than 2 years old stem that is very firm and thick. </p>



<p>Rooting using softwood stem cuttings is easier. But plants developed from semi-hardwood cutting are stronger. They also bloom much quicker than plants grown from softwood cutting. I will take a stem cutting from both semi-hardwood and softwood. Cut the stem right below the node region. The node region is where a leaf comes out from the stem. The length of the cutting should be around 8-10 inches. After cutting the stems make sure to place them in water so that it is kept moist.</p>



<h4>4 Prepare Jasmine Cuttings</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-144 wp-block-gallery-143 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="532"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Prepare-Jasmine-Cuttings.webp" alt="Prepare Jasmine Cuttings" class="wp-image-532"/><figcaption>Prepare Jasmine Cuttings</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To prepare a jasmine stem for cutting you need to first remove the growing tips. Then remove any flowers or buds present on it. This ensures the stem does not waste its energy in shoot and flower growth. All the energy is now utilized in root development. </p>



<p>Next, remove the lower leaves to expose the 2 nodes. The node region is where the root development is most likely to start. This is because the node region has got unspecialized cells. This means depending upon the environment the node region can develop a new branch, new leaf, or a new root. So by placing 2 nodes under the soil. You are doing your chances of root development.</p>



<p>Next cut the leaves in half using scissors or hands. This will reduce water loss from the pores present at the bottom of the leaves. It will also reduce the space requirement in your humidity dome. </p>



<h4>5 Cutting Growing Conditions</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-146 wp-block-gallery-145 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="533"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Cutting-Growing-Conditions.webp" alt="Cutting Growing Conditions" class="wp-image-533"/><figcaption>Cutting Growing Conditions</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To grow plants from cutting you need to place them in a suitable growing environment. They should be placed in a place that has very high humidity. The temperature range should be 25-30°C and bright indirect sunlight is required. To achieve this I will place the cuttings facing the north. At this location, it will receive bright diffused sunlight reflected from our house wall. If you are growing in a dry climate you will also need to add a humidity dome. You can easily create a humidity dome from a plastic soda pet bottle. Simply cut the bottom part of the 2-liter soda pet bottle. Cover your pot with this pet bottle without the cap. The hole at the top allows the hot air to escape. The lighter humid air settles down in the cutting-growing region.  You can also create a humidity dome using plastic polythene bags. I will show you how to do it later on in this article. </p>



<h4>6 Cutting Growing Medium</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-148 wp-block-gallery-147 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="534"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Cutting-Growing-Medium.webp" alt="Cutting Growing Medium" class="wp-image-534"/><figcaption>Cutting Growing Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>To grow cuttings the rooting medium should be light, fast-draining, and inert. Perlite checks all these boxes so we will be using it for rooting our jasmine cuttings. Other alternatives can be peat moss, coco peat, and river sand. All these are inert which means it does not support the growth of fungus and bacteria. Because the cuttings initially do not have a root system. They are vulnerable to fungus and bacteria infection. It is essential to select a medium that inhibits the growth of these pathogens. </p>



<h4>7 Create Humidity Dome Supports</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-150 wp-block-gallery-149 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="535"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Create-Humidity-Dome-Supports.webp" alt="Create Humidity Dome Supports" class="wp-image-535"/><figcaption>Create Humidity Dome Supports</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Now let&#8217;s start creating our humidity dome from a plastic bag. First, we need some kind of support for the plastic bag. This will make sure that the plastic bag does not touch the cuttings. In addition, it will prevent the plastic bag from collapsing with the wind. For the support take three sticks of equal length. They should be long enough to prevent the plastic bag from touching the cuttings. Insert the sticks in a triangular shape to provide support in all three directions. Next, we need to water the rooting medium.</p>



<h4>8 Hydrate the Rooting Medium</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-152 wp-block-gallery-151 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="536"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Hydrate-the-Rooting-Medium.webp" alt="Hydrate the Rooting Medium" class="wp-image-536"/><figcaption>Hydrate the Rooting Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Using fine shower water the rooting medium thoroughly. Water it till you see water dripping out from the bottom of the pot. Once that happens you are sure that it&#8217;s completely saturated with water. </p>



<h4>9 Add Cutting in Rooting Medium</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-154 wp-block-gallery-153 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="537"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Add-Cutting-in-Rooting-Medium.webp" alt="Add Cutting in Rooting Medium" class="wp-image-537"/><figcaption>Add Cutting in Rooting Medium</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Use a pencil or your finger to create holes in the rooting medium. If you are growing a semi-hardwood cutting you should use a rooting hormone. The rooting hormone stimulates root development. It increases the chances of successful cutting root growth. Adding rooting hormone to your cutting is quite simple. Dip the rooting end of the cutting in water. Then dip the cutting in the rooting hormone powder which will stick to it. Tap the cutting to remove excess rooting hormone powder. Place the cutting in the hole created previously. Using your fingers firm up the rooting medium around the cutting. Repeat the step for the remaining cuttings. Once all the cuttings are placed in the rooting medium. Water it thoroughly so that all the air gaps between the cutting and rooting medium are filled with water. </p>



<h4>10 Add Plastic Bag Humidity Dome</h4>



<figure class="wp-container-156 wp-block-gallery-155 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1365" height="768" data-id="538"  src="https://plantsmylove.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Add-Plastic-Bag-Humidity-Dome.webp" alt="Add Plastic Bag Humidity Dome" class="wp-image-538"/><figcaption>Add Plastic Bag Humidity Dome</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Okay, now the last step is to add the plastic humidity dome. I will use two plastic bags to create the humidity dome. One plastic bag will cover it from the bottom and the other from the top. I am using two polybags because I do not have a single big enough plastic bag to cover it completely from the top. To add the bottom plastic bag roll it and place the pot in the middle. Now unroll to the top and support it using the sticks. Now add the second plastic bag similarly from the top. Roll the plastic bag and place it on the stick supports. Now from the top unroll it downwards to overlap the bottom plastic bag. Now create a small went at the top by making a hole. Add a mineral water bottle top to support the went in place.</p>

<ol><li>The solar dehydrator is black in color to absorb the maximum amount of sunlight.</li><li>The inclination of the solar dehydrtor allows the moist lighter air to escape from the top.</li><li>The dry air is fed in from the vents at the bottom of the box.</li><li>In direct sunlight the contents of the box is heated up and releases moisture in the air.</li><li>This moist air rises to the top and escapes out from the vents leaving dry air behind.</li><li>Over time this process is repeated and slowly the contents of the box get dehydrated.</li></ol>



<h4>1 Dry Bones in Sun for 15 days</h4>
